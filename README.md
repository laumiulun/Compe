### Getting Started ###
The program will actively look for file with the name “config.py” which contain the relative and absolute tolerance set by user.  The same directory that contain the configuration files must also contain two data files, which must be named:

	“goldfile.txt”
	“test.txt”

The program will compare the two data set and output locations of which it exceed the tolerances set up by “config.py”.
